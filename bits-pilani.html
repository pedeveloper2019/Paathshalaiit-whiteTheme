                                The Birla Institute of Technology & Science, BITS Pilani is an all-India Institute for
                                higher education. The primary motive of BITS is to "train young men and women able and
                                eager to create and put into action such ideas, methods, techniques and information".
                                The Institute is a dream come true of its founder late Mr G.D.Birla - an eminent
                                industrialist, a participant in Indian freedom struggle and a close associate of the
                                Father of Indian Nation late Mr. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (Mahatma Gandhi). What
                                started in early 1900s as a small school, blossomed into a set of colleges for higher
                                education, ranging from the Humanities to Engineering until 1964 when all these colleges
                                amalgamated to culminate into a unique Indian University of International standing. This
                                university was christened as the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani,
                                known to many as BITS, Pilani.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Over the years, BITS has provided the highest quality technical education to students
                                from all over India admitted on the basis of merit. Its graduates may be found
                                throughout the world in all areas of engineering, science and commerce. BITS symbolizes
                                the maturing of Indian technical ability and "can-do" entrepreneurial spirit, especially
                                as derived from the private sector. BITS is located in the Vidya Vihar campus adjacent
                                to the town of Pilani in Rajasthan.

                                Offered at the first tier, these degrees have nomenclature like B.E. (Hons.), B.Pharm.
                                (Hons.), M.M.S (Master of Management Studies), M.Sc. (Hons.), M.Sc. (Tech.), and M.A.
                                (Hons.). These are level wise equivalent degrees. They are considered to be integrated
                                degrees for two reasons: (i) the degree program includes several cross disciplinary
                                common coursessuch as basic math and science and, (ii) no intermediate degree, like,
                                B.Sc., B.Sc. (Hons.), B.A., B.A. (Hons), etc. is awarded. These degrees are modular in
                                structure and academic requirements are spelt out in terms of the number of courses
                                studied rather than the number of years. All our programmes are designed in a way to
                                facilitate completion within eight semesters. Our flexible academic policy gives
                                students the option to complete their degree both at a faster pace (finishing it earlier
                                than 8 semesters) as well as at a slower pace to finish it in later than 8 semesters.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                B.E.(Hons.) These programmes in engineering are mathematics and hard science based and
                                incorporate many up-to-date techniques of analysis and synthesis.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                B.Pharm.(Hons.) Our B.Pharm.(Hons.) programme has been structured to match and exceed
                                the requirements of the Pharmacy Council of India. The programme offers students
                                additional courses which give the shape and flavour of engineering as well as
                                fundamental sciences giving an added dimension to the studentâ€™s academics.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                M.Sc.(Hons.) These are integrated degree programmes without any intermediate B.Sc.
                                degree. While these programmes ensure the required science component in any comparable
                                postgraduate science degrees of other universities, they also incorporate many courses
                                which have been notionally considered to be the domain of engineers. The integrated
                                nature of the programmes and their analytical and engineering science contents give them
                                a added professional character and equips students with the skills and problem solving
                                abilities to participate usefully in industrial jobs. While a capable student with a
                                10+2 background may be able to complete these programmes in four years, students with a
                                10+2+3 background with a B.Sc. degree, admitted on advanced standing basis will require
                                two to three years to finish the programme. The vast majority of students who are
                                admitted for these degrees also aspire and work for a second degree from B.E. (Hons.),
                                M.M.S., B.Pharm. degrees under the dual degree scheme.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                M.Sc.(Tech.) These programmes are multi-disciplinary, technological in character and are
                                designed to meet the requirements of newly emerging professional activities. While these
                                programmes are also science and technology based, their requirements of mathematics,
                                science, applied science etc. will be different from B.E. (Hons.) and M.Sc. (Hons.). The
                                areas which are currently incorporated in these degree programmes are Engineering
                                Technology, Information Systems, Finance and General Studies.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Engineering Technology programme gives students an exposure across all engineering
                                disciplines and emphasizes knowledge of the operation of various technological units.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The programme on Information Systems equips students with comprehensive skills on
                                computer software and software engineering techniques, both at the conceptual and
                                application levels.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Finance degree has been designed to meet the manpower needs due to the new thrust
                                given to growth patterns in the economy. The courses planned for this programme meet the
                                skill set requirements of financial institutions as well as financial management needs
                                of any industry. The programme is complementary to the M.Sc.(Hons.) Economics programme
                                and the MMS programme.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The General Studies programme does not have any specific discipline objective. However,
                                the course is charted out in a way that candidates take humanities courses as well as
                                certain general science and technology courses. Students sometimes also seek to acquire
                                specific skills to meet varied career objectives by making planned use of electives and
                                project oriented courses.
