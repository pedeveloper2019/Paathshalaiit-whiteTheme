                        To merely explain my experience and emotions with Paathshala with a few words ? Oh Boy! It's going to be a task between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea. My 2 year experience here was an adventure. Professors here helped me a lot in teaching, doubts, concepts clarification. I would say they are true experts of their subjects. The professors here are the best! The environment and ambience of the classrooms was far beyond my expectation. Good infrastructure, comfortable benches, quality teaching facilities, you name it! Learning here was fun and the environment maintained by the teachers was cherry on the cake. Our senior students also gave us the information about the mighty class in our 11 Std. I was also given the right guidance about the books to be referred to in addition to the study materials provided. I would rest my case on a final note that, if Paathshala is given the opportunity to compete at the higher level, it would gain all the honours and respect it truly deserves!!

                            My experience with Paathshala is absolutely fantastic. In the beginning itself, Professor Sagar Sir had given Nihar a view of the goal and how to reach that goal and how to start. Taking admission here did wonders for Nihar. The way of teaching by the faculties was very good as Nihar was very enthusiastic and loved going to Paathshala classes without missing even a single class. All the credit for Nihar’s success in the exams goes to the staff and faculty of Paathshala.

                            My experience at Paathshala is wonderful; the teachers are very helpful, they provide personalized attention to the student. I studied for about 5-6 hours daily. I gave more time to the subject I was weak at. I revised the topics done in the class daily. And this helped me a lot in improving my scores in the exams. I also learnt how to manage my time and how not to make silly mistakes. The professors are knowledgeable and I give them a rating of 10/10. I was also counseled about the opportunities available to me after successful completion of JEE. I am planning to do Mechanical Engineering at IIT.

                            It is a good thing that Paathshala is providing personalized attention to students. This helps students to ask their doubts and also the professor to gauge the understanding of the student. It helps them to gain confidence when the concepts are cleared and the results will be definitely good. I will give 100% credit of Saurabh's success to Paathshala as they are service oriented.

The professors are experienced and provide us in depth knowledge of the subject. My scores improved a lot in all the subjects. For the future batches of Paathshala, I will say that you should stick to the portion and the study material that is provided. Whenever you have doubts, get it cleared with the professors. The study materials, the class notes and the assignments given at the class are enough for getting good marks in JEE. I also got to know tips and techniques and time management strategies from the counselor which were very helpful. My rating of Paathshala is 10/10 as the staff and faculty are very supportive.

They taught me how to manage time effectively while solving questions. The professors cleared all my conceptual doubts in such a way that I could put them into application and use them to solve the problems correctly. For the JEE aspirants, I would like to say that study all the concepts but do a smart study. Revise whatever you have learnt thoroughly and solve maximum practice questions.

                            We had a wonderful and happy experience at Paathshala. All the faculties gave Devansh personalized attention and solved all his doubts. We used to get the guidance from professors from time to time. All these have contributed towards Devansh succeeding in JEE Advanced. Before the exams, the professors explained to us which topic is to be covered, which topic should be solved and Devansh's success is to be attributed to the fact that he scored minimum negative marks in both JEE Main and JEE Advanced. To the entrance exam aspirants, we would say, there has to be regular study by the student for 2 years. The student should be thorough with the concepts, formulas, theory, definition and clear the doubts immediately with the professors.

                        The most striking thing you experience with the professors of Paathshala is their passion for teaching and the mastery over the subject that makes a huge difference from the perspective of a student. They are very interactive with the students. The professors could clear the conceptual doubts of each student. They connect well with the students in solving their doubts. Professors are frank in their feedback without mincing words.

                            I had a really great experience at Paathshala. Since we were taught in small batches, it was very effective as we could understand the concepts clearly. Our syllabus was completed twice. That gave us the edge over our competitors. Our professors were friendly and understanding. Attending classes was fun. All in all, my experience at Paathshala was thrilling.

                        It is a great feeling to have been a student of Paathshala, have gotten to learn from all the professors here. Every professor has taught me valuable life lessons too. [After my 10th Std, I have joined a different institute but over there, my concepts were not being clarified] Hence, I have joined Paathshala later. My concept clarity strengthened with time. My frequency of solving problems without making silly mistakes has increased. Also, the time taken by me for solving each sum has reduced. This capability has become an integral part of me. I have also learnt a lot about life at Paathshala. I can feel the connection between Maths and Life. 'Integration' taught me that if you keep adding up small efforts, you WILL make it large despite any obstacles of 'what to substitute'. Plus, you will get the added bonus of '+C' in the end. It's your life, make it large!

                            Her professors are intelligent, knowledgeable and dedicated. My daughter really benefited from the class as she learnt the subjects in depth. She was given daily assignments to complete. It really improved her test scores including MCQs. For the NEET aspirants, I will say one has to be very focused and planned with studies. Also, indulge in extra curricular activities like sports or music to relax.

                        I have good experience studying at Paathshala. Here the student gets all the required facilities and study material required for perfect preparation. The classification of the topics into subtopics has helped in better understanding of the concepts in that topic. Also, the classes are conducted in small batches which enables the professor to give personalized attention to the student. The student is encouraged to ask questions and clear all his doubts. I was initially in a different institute before joining Paathshala. I would have to work much much harder if I were at some other institute, where they start the portion slowly but in the end moments they finish the portion. That too they don’t teach properly. They give you a mix bag of theories; you need to go into it and search out the important points. Here at Paathshala Education, the professors are knowledgeable and provided personalized attention to each student and clear all their doubts on the subject. They guide you properly and give what is actually required. For entrance exam aspirants, I would say do not count the number of hours you study instead solve more conceptual questions because this is what that develops our concepts. As soon as you finish theory, start off with practice papers of previous years and solve them as much as possible.

                            Before joining Paathshala, my experience with another institute was not good. At Paathshala, I was able to understand the concepts of the subject clearly and became confident and interested in the subjects. The professors taught me from the basics of 11th standard and made me capable of solving MCQs of JEE Main level quickly. Also, I was made to solve lots of questions from previous years' tests. I could understand the questions and what I am supposed to answer. I would advise the future batches of Paathshala to stay focused on studies, clear your concepts of each topic and solve as many questions as possible. And beware of the marketing strategies used by the coaching classes and don't fall prey to them. I did initially fall prey to such tactics and joined a different class before joining Paathshlala and had to leave it eventually.

                        My experience with the Professors at Paathshala Education has been amazing. The professors are friendly and knowledgeable. The syllabus was completed early. Due to small size of the batch, we got personalized attention from the faculty. Also audio visuals and small videos are shown in the class to make the study more understandable and entertaining. Compared to Paathshala, when I was at another institute before joining Paathshala, their method of teaching was different and I could not understand the concepts well. At Paathshala, the professors ensured that I understood the concepts and its application correctly. Each topic is categorized into divisions for better understanding. Plus there are lots of practice questions to be solved which help us to gain confidence.

                            The faculty was very good; they helped me in learning the concepts really well. The classrooms and infrastructure radiate the concept of education and that keeps us focused on studies all the time. The Academics and the Test modules were very helpful. Earlier I had no idea of what type of questions would be asked. These modules helped me on not only how to solve the paper but also time management. The Academics modules helped me understand the concepts well for my college exams as well. For the future batches in Paathshala and JEE/NEET aspirants, my advice would be, not to panic or stress. One has to only study hard, understand the concepts well and solve maximum number of previous years’ questions. I motivated myself to prepare well for the exams without getting stressed; listening to music in my spare time was a booster. Some of my school friends used to ask me questions from other institutes' module which I could easily answer. So, by being a student of Paathshala, I had the competitive advantage over students from other institutes.

                        My experience at Paathshala was mind-blowing. Here the students are taught in small batches and so the Professors were able to give good attention which is very good for the student. The Professors clear all our doubts easily, they encourage us to ask questions and are very supportive. After the JEE Main, some of my friends, mentioned to me they did not do well. But for me, thanks to Paathshala, I performed much better than the others. This is because Paathshala conducted various Chapter Wise Tests, later on the Full Syllabus Tests were given. The level of tests at Paathshala were also higher so that we do not get nervous during the actual exam. The counsellors and professors were co-operative and helped us in time management, suggested what additional books to buy and to how to solve extra papers at home. For a JEE aspirant, I would suggest, the preparation should start from XI Std itself without taking any stress. There should be very less use of mobile phone for these two years and the student should be focused only on studies. I have good memories of studying at Paathshala that I will cherish.

The professors have really guided us well. I have put in a lot of effort, even the faculty were putting a lot of effort in making me understand the concepts very well. The Paathshala Education Academics and Test module and also the other resources were nice and really helped me in solving a good amount of questions. Any doubts in the content, I could ask the Professors any time. Regular problem solving helped me increase my level. During this period, I restricted myself to only about very limited mobile usage. I had a competitive advantage over my friends who were studying at other classes because the Paathshala module questions were definitely at a higher level with proper solutions. For a JEE aspirant, I would say that you need to focus thoroughly on studies in these 2 years, and also not to get distracted by others.

After that, I have taken admision at Paathshala. My experience at Paathshala has been wonderful. Paathshala is one of the best classes in Mumbai and even Maharashtra. The professors are very good, friendly and supportive. I just want to say this: If you are searching for the best class in Mumbai, then it is Paathshala. I am completely overwhelmed to have been a student of Paathshala. The way in which Paathshala counselors keep you motivated, focused and goal oriented from time to time is amazing. I am speechless!

                        My experience at Paathshala was very good. My friend, Lalit reccommended me to join Paathshala and I thank Lalit for this. Preparation for JEE Exam is a difficult task but the guidance given by the professors here made the things easier. Highly experienced professors of Paathshala have supported and guided us at every step during the preparation. Studying at Paathshala was actually full of fun for me. Paathshala is the right place for entrance exam preparation and my journey at Paathshala has been the most fulfilling one.

                            In the previous institute I studied earlier, I had many conceptual doubts which was a setback in the MCQ performance. After coming to Paathshala, I got personalized attention from various faculties, and continuous clarification of doubts, helped me solve the questions appropriately. When the conceptual doubts are cleared, then the question solving ability is developed automatically. Also you should attempt all the Part Syllabus, Full Syllabus and Topic Wise Tests to get the confidence for scoring high marks in competitive exams. For the future batches at Paathshala, I would say that this is the best institute where personalized attention is given to the student.

                        The Professors at Paathshala have a good knowledge of the fundamentals and advanced concepts of the subject. Some of the Professors have a good sense of humor too! The Professors method of explaining the topics is simple. They divide the topics into categories and sub-categories that are easy to remember. The best way to crack the JEE exams is to initially focus on the fundamentals and give each topic a lot of time. Secondly, towards the later days you should practice 50 full syllabus of Mains tests and 50 full syllabus of Advance tests. This will really help you a lot.

                            I joined Paathshala a bit late and now wish I had joined earlier. The guidance that Paathshala provides cannot be found anywhere else. I have learnt how to prepare for the exam and solve the questions in a time based manner. The professors and counselors here motivate us and show us the right direction which will enable us to excel in the exams. For entrance exam aspirants, I would say, you need to be strong in the concepts. Do not spend too much time on difficult questions. Work hard, study smart.

                        I am Sanika’s father. I had been told that the teaching at Paathshala is at a different level. The topics are categorized and the concepts are taught thoroughly for better understanding and then there are tests on each topic followed by Full Syllabus Tests. Then the JEE Main syllabus is taught so that the concepts are clear, the approach to the problem is clear and only the difficulty level increases. They taught her how to systematically prepare for the exams, how to write the answer, and she became confident in the subject.

The Academics and Tests module helped me to solve more variety of questions in limited time and taught me how to manage time effectively. For the future batches of Paathshala, I would say that you should make efforts to understand all the concepts by revising them, clearing the doubts with the Professors. Do not get distracted with Facebook, YouTube, Whatsapp, Instagram etc. for these two precious years and concentrate only on studies. At Paathshala, I learnt how to categorize a topic and study the concepts which made learning very easy.

The way me and my batchmates were taught was fabulous. The professors actually created interest in studies. Because of Paathshala, I actually scored very well in my exams. The way we were guided and given tips for problem solving is very good and confidence boosting.

The Academics and Tests module helped me prepare well and improve my scores as I solved as many questions to gain confidence. For an entrance exam aspirant, I would say you should stay focused on studies and it is important that you should solve lots of practice questions keeping a timer. It is advisable to keep away from all distractions especially social media for these two years. Use your mobile only when required and do not spend too much time on it. What I appreciate about Paathshala is that they are goal oriented and the smaller batch size enables the Professors to give personalized attention to the student.

You need to be calm and not take any stress. To JEE Aspirants, I would say, ask your doubts to the faculty and get the concepts cleared and also solve lots of questions from previous years tests. This will give you the confidence to write the paper well and without any stress.

                        My experience at Paathshala was very good. I felt very comfortable here. The teachers taught and explained the concepts very nicely. They also made hard concepts easy to understand. We have gotten personalized attention from the professors because we were taught in small batches. I have enjoyed learning all the subjects here, Physics, Chemistry and Maths, my favourite subject being Physics.
