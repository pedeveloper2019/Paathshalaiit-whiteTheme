                                The Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) are autonomous public institutes of higher
                                education, located in India. They are governed by the Institutes of Technology Act, 1961
                                which has declared them as institutions of national importance and lays down their
                                powers, duties, and framework for governance etc. The Institutes of Technology Act, 1961
                                lists twenty-three institutes (after the last amendment in 2016). Each IIT is an
                                autonomous institution, linked to the others through a common IIT Council, which
                                oversees their administration. The Minister of Human Resource Development is the
                                ex-officio Chairperson of IIT Council. As of 2018, the total number of seats for
                                undergraduate programmes in all IITs is 11,279.

                                The first IIT was set up in Kharagpur in 1951, and soon later in Bombay (1958), Madras
                                (1959), Kanpur (1959) and Delhi (1963). An IIT was then established in Guwahati in 1994.
                                The University of Roorkee was converted to IIT Roorkee in 2001. Eight new IITs were set
                                up in Gandhinagar, Jodhpur, Hyderabad, Indore, Patna, Bhubaneswar, Ropar, and Mandi in
                                2008-09. Following same selection process since 1972, finally in 2012 the Institute of
                                Technology, Banaras Hindu University was given IIT status. Another six new IITs in
                                Tirupati, Palakkad, Dharwad, Bhilai, Goa and Jammu, approved through a 2016 bill
                                amendment were established in 2015-16, along with the conversion of ISM Dhanbad to IIT

                                The IITs have a common admission process for undergraduate admissions, the Joint
                                Entrance Examination - Advanced, formerly called the IIT-JEE until 2012. JEE Advanced
                                admits students according to their ranks in the exam. The post-graduate level program
                                that awards M.Tech., MS degrees, and the doctoral programme that offers Ph.D. in
                                engineering is administered by the older IITs. M.Tech. and MS admissions are done on the
                                basis of Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE). Additionally, IITs also award
                                other graduate degrees such as M.Sc in Maths, Physics and Chemistry, MBA, etc. Admission
                                to these programs of IITs is done through Common Admission Test (CAT), Joint Admission
                                Test for M.Sc. (JAM) and Common Entrance Examination for Design (CEED). IIT Guwahati and
                                IIT Bombay offer undergraduate design programmes as well. Joint Seat Allocation
                                Authority conducts the joint admission process for a total of 23 IITs, that offer

                                The IITs receive comparatively higher grants than other engineering colleges in India.
                                While the total government funding to most other engineering colleges is around Rs.
                                10–20 crores (USD 2–4 million) per year, the amount varies between Rs. 90 crores –130
                                crores (USD 18–26 million) per year for each IIT. Other sources of funds include student
                                fees and research funding from industry and contributions from the alumni. The
                                faculty-to-student ratio in the IITs is between 1:6 and 1:8. The Standing Committee of
                                IIT Council (SCIC) prescribes the lower limit for faculty-to-student ratio as 1:9,
                                applied department wise. The IITs subsidise undergraduate student fees by approximately
                                80% and provide scholarships to all Master of Technology students and Research Scholars
                                in order to encourage students for higher studies, per the recommendations of the
                                Thacker Committee (1959–1961).[34] The cost borne by undergraduate students is around
                                Rs. 180,000 per annum. After students from SC and ST categories, physically challenged
                                students will now[when?] be the beneficiaries of fee waiver at the IITs in India.

                                The various IITs function autonomously, and their special status as Institutes of
                                National Importance facilitates the smooth running of IITs, virtually free from both
                                regional as well as student politics. Such autonomy means that IITs can create their own
                                curricula and adapt rapidly to the changes in educational requirements, free from
                                bureaucratic hurdles. The government has no direct control over internal policy
                                decisions of IITs (like faculty recruitment and curricula) but has representation on the
                                IIT Council. The medium of instruction in all IITs is English. The classes are usually
                                held between 7:30 am and 5:30 pm, though there are some variations within each IIT. All
                                the IITs have public libraries for the use of their students. In addition to a
                                collection of prescribed books, the libraries have sections for fiction and other
                                literary genres. The electronic libraries allow students to access on-line journals and
                                periodicals. The IITs and IISc have taken an initiative along with Ministry of Human
                                Resource Development to provide free online videos of actual lectures of different
                                disciplines under National Program on Technology Enhanced Learning. This initiative is
                                undertaken to make quality education accessible to all students.

                                The academic policies of each IIT are decided by its Senate. This comprises all
                                professors of the IIT and student representatives. Unlike many western universities that
                                have an elected senate, the IITs have an academic senate. It controls and approves the
                                curriculum, courses, examinations and results, and appoints committees to look into
                                specific academic matters. The teaching, training and research activities of the
                                institute are periodically reviewed by the senate to maintain educational standards. The
                                Director of an IIT is the ex-officio Chairman of the Senate.

                                Central Library, IIT Roorkee All the IITs follow the credits system of performance
                                evaluation, with proportional weighting of courses based on their importance. The total
                                marks (usually out of 100) form the basis of grades, with a grade value (out of 10)
                                assigned to a range of marks. Sometimes, relative grading is done considering the
                                overall performance of the whole class. For each semester, the students are graded on a
                                scale of 0 to 10 based on their performance, by taking a weighted average of the grade
                                points from all the courses, with their respective credit points. Each semester
                                evaluation is done independently and then the weighted average over all semesters is
                                used to calculate the cumulative grade point average (known as CGPA or CPI—Cumulative
                                Performance Index).

                                5-year programs with ten semesters. In all IITs, the first year of BTech and Dual Degree
                                courses are marked by a common course structure for all the students, though in some
                                IITs, a single department introduction related course is also included. The common
                                courses include the basics from most of the departments like Electronics, Mechanics,
                                Chemistry, Electrical and Physics. At the end of first year (the end of first semester
                                at IIT Madras, IIT Hyderabad and IIT Roorkee), an option to change departments is given
                                to meritorious students on the basis of their performance in the first two semesters.
                                Few such changes ultimately take place as the criteria for them are usually strict,
                                limited to the most meritorious students.

                                From the second year onwards, the students study subjects exclusively from their
                                respective departments. In addition to these, the students have to take compulsory
                                advanced courses from other departments in order to broaden their education. Separate
                                compulsory courses from humanities and social sciences department, and sometimes
                                management courses are also enforced. In the last year of their studies, most of the
                                students are placed into industries and organisations via the placement process of the
                                respective IIT, though some students opt out of this either when going for higher
                                studies or when they take up jobs by applying to the companies directly.

                                Master's degrees and postgraduate diplomas The IITs offer a number of postgraduate
                                programs including Master of Technology (MTech), Master of Business Administration (MBA)
                                (only for engineers and post graduates in science), and Master of Science (MSc). Some
                                IITs offer specialised graduate programmes such as Master of Design (M.Des.), the Post
                                Graduate Diploma in Information Technology (PGDIT), Master in Medical Science and
                                Technology (MMST), Master of City Planning (MCP), Master of Arts (MA), Postgraduate
                                Diploma in Intellectual Property Law (PGDIPL), and the Postgraduate Diploma in Maritime

                                programs respectively. Admissions to masters programs in engineering are made using
                                scores of the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE), while those to masters
                                programs in science are made using scores of the Joint Admission Test to MSc (JAM).

                                Bachelors-Masters dual degrees The IITs also offer an unconventional BTech and MTech
                                integrated educational program called "Dual Degree". It integrates undergraduate and
                                postgraduate studies in selected areas of specialisation. It is completed in five years
                                as against six years in conventional BTech (four years) followed by an MTech (two
                                years). Integrated Master of Science programs are also offered at few IITs which
                                integrates the Undergraduate and Postgraduate studies in Science streams in a single
                                degree program against the conventional University system. These programs were started
                                to allow IITians to complete postgraduate studies from IIT rather than having to go to
                                another institute.

                                Doctoral degrees The IITs also offer the Doctor of Philosophy degree (PhD) as part of
                                their doctoral education programme. In it, the candidates are given a topic of academic
                                interest by the professor or have to work on a consultancy project given by the
                                industries. The duration of the program is usually unspecified and depends on the
                                specific discipline. PhD candidates have to submit a dissertation as well as provide an
                                oral defence for their thesis. Teaching Assistantships (TA) and Research Assistantships
                                (RA) are often provided.
