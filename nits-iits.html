                                The NITs along with the IITs receive comparatively higher grants than other engineering
                                colleges in India. Average NIT funding increased to ₹100 crores ($15.4 million) by year
                                2011. On average, each NIT also receives ₹ 20-25 crore ($3-3.8 million) under World Bank
                                funded Technical Education Quality Improvement Program (TEQIP I and TEQIP II). Other
                                sources of funds include student fees and research funding from industry and
                                contributions from the alumni. The faculty-to-student ratio in the NITs is between 1:7
                                and 1:9. The cost borne by undergraduate students is around ₹ 125,000 ($1934) per annum.
                                After students from SC and ST categories, physically challenged students will now be the
                                beneficiaries of fee waiver at the NITs in India.

                                The various NITs function autonomously, and their special status as Institutes of
                                National Importance facilitates the smooth running of NITs, virtually free from both
                                regional as well as student politics. Such autonomy means that NITs can create their own
                                curricula and adapt rapidly to the changes in educational requirements, free from
                                bureaucratic hurdles. The medium of instruction in all NITs is English. The classes are
                                usually held between 8:30 am and 5:30 pm, though there are some variations within each
                                NIT. All the NITs have public libraries for the use of their students. In addition to a
                                collection of prescribed books, the libraries have sections for fiction and other
                                literary genres. Electronic libraries allow students access to online journals and other
                                periodicals through the AICTE-INDEST consortium, an initiative by the Ministry of Human
                                Resource Development. Students also have access to IEEE documents and journals.

                                The academic policies of each IIT are decided by its Senate. This comprises all
                                professors of the IIT and student representatives. Unlike many western universities that
                                have an elected senate, the IITs have an academic senate. It controls and approves
                                the curriculum, courses, examinations and results, and appoints committees to look into
                                specific academic matters. The teaching, training and research activities of the
                                institute are periodically reviewed by the senate
                                to maintain educational standards. The Director of an IIT is the ex-officio Chairman of
                                the Senate.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Stringent faculty recruitment and industry collaboration also contribute to NIT success.
                                Faculty other than lecturers must have a Ph.D. and relevant teaching and industry
                                experience. Existing faculty who do not meet these criteria enroll under a Quality
                                Improvement Programme (QIP) at IITs and IISc.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                All the NITs follow the credits system of performance evaluation, with proportional
                                weighting of courses based on their importance. The total marks (usually out of 100)
                                form the basis of grades, with a grade value (out of 10) assigned to a range of marks.
                                Sometimes, relative grading is done considering the overall performance of the whole
                                class. For each semester, the students are graded on a scale of 0 to 10 based on their
                                performance, by taking a weighted average of the grade points from all the courses, with
                                their respective credit points. Each semester evaluation is done independently and then
                                the weighted average over all semesters is used to calculate the cumulative grade point
                                average (CGPA).

                                The Bachelor of Technology (BTech) degree is the most common undergraduate degree in the
                                NITs in terms of student enrollment. The BTech course is based on a 4-year program with
                                eight semesters, while the Dual Degree and Integrated courses are 5-year programs with
                                ten semesters. In all NITs, the first year of BTech and Dual Degree courses are marked
                                by a common course structure for all the students, though in some NITs, a single
                                department introduction related course is also included. The common courses include the
                                basics from most of the departments like Electronics, Mechanics, Chemistry, Electrical
                                and Physics. At the end of first year, some NITs offer an option to the meritorious
                                students to change departments on the basis of their performance in the first two
                                semesters. Few such changes ultimately take place as the criteria for them are usually
                                strict, limited to the most meritorious students. Few NITs also offer 5-year Bachelor of
                                Architecture (BArch) and 4-year Bachelor of Science (BSc) degrees.

                                From the second year onwards, the students study subjects exclusively from their
                                respective departments. In addition to these, the students have to take compulsory
                                advanced courses from other departments in order to broaden their education. Separate
                                compulsory courses from humanities and social sciences department, and sometimes
                                management courses are also enforced. In the last year of their studies, most of the
                                students are placed into industries and organisations via the placement process of the
                                respective NIT, though some students opt out of this either when going for higher
                                studies or when they take up jobs by applying to the companies directly.

                                Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs) are a group of institutes of higher
                                education in India, focused on information technology. Five of them are established,
                                funded and managed by the Ministry of Human Resource Development. The rest are set up on
                                the public-private partnership (PPP) model.

                                Prior to 2010, the IIITs at Gwalior, Allahabad, Jabalpur and Kancheepuram were set up by
                                the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD).

                                Sabha.[citation needed] The bill sought to grants the status of Institutes of National
                                Importance (INI) upon the four IIITs. After much debate and changes, the bill was passed
                                by the Parliament on December 1, 2014[citation needed] and published as the Indian
                                Institutes of Information Technology Act, 2014 on 8 December 2014, coming into effect on

                                In 2015, a fifth institute was set up by the MHRD in Kurnool,[1] as part as the
                                government obligation under the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014. The Indian
                                Institutes of Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2017 granted the INI status to the
                                Kurnool institute.

                                Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh and in Bodhjungnagar, Tripura. In addition, in 2015 the MHRD
                                approved an IIIT in Nagpur, Maharashtra and in Ranchi, Jharkhand. An IIIT in Bhagalpur,
                                Bihar was approved in 2016. Finally, to close the list of 20, an IIIT in Surat, Gujarat
                                was approved and set up in 2017. As of September 2017, these four institutes were
