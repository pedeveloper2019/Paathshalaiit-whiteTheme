                        In Paathshala classrooms, the use of teaching models and demonstrating small experiments in class, especially across a table and while learning topics like solid state chemistry and reaction mechanisms in organic chemistry, optical isomerism etc makes the student understand the concepts involved much better and faster and this leads the student having more knowledge and deeper understanding about such complicated topics involving spatial reasoning.

                        The students will be regularly assessed through the Topic Wise Tests(TWTs) which would be conducted as soon as a given topic is completed in the class, the marks of which would be communicated to the parents. Once the syllabus is completed, the students will be made to give full syllabus end-of-the course test series which would be of the same pattern as the competitive exams they are preparing for. Intermittently we also provide students with part syllabus tests. Because it is only practice that makes a student perfect.

                        Student Welfare Activities, conducted by Paathshala Education act as a Continuous Motivation and Support system for students.There is a dedicated team of professionals called the Student Welfare Team, which is driven to provide constant support, guidance and counselling to the students on a regular basis. The students are supposed to report to the Student Welfare Team about what they have studied on a given day as a part of self study as well as classwork, and if they have any impending doubts. The progress of the student will be communicated to the parents on a weekly basis as a weekly study report with appropriate feedback and improvement suggestions. A short surprize viva may also conducted on the topics which have been covered by the student as a part of self study. This helps the student stay on the foot and re-enforces the concept of regular guided studies.

                                        with Paathshala with a few words ? Oh Boy! It's going to be a task between the
                                        Devil and the Deep Blue Sea. My 2 year experience here was an adventure.
                                        Professors here helped me a lot in teaching, doubts, concepts clarification. I
                                        would say they are true experts of their subjects. The professors here are the
                                        best! The environment and ambience of the classrooms was far beyond my
                                        expectation. Good infrastructure, comfortable benches, quality teaching
                                        facilities, you name it! Learning here was fun and the environment maintained by
                                        the teachers was cherry on the cake. Our senior students also gave us the
                                        information about the mighty class in our 11 Std. I was also given the right
                                        guidance about the books to be referred to in addition to the study materials
                                        provided. The periodical tests and practice questions given by Paathshala were
                                        really challenging, not sub-standard as given by other classes. This motivated
                                        me to go deeper into the subject and clear my doubts. The more you practice, the
                                        more skilled you become. For NEET aspirants, I would say never leave your
                                        doubts. Get them clarified with your professors. Keep a tab with whatever is
                                        being taught in class and don't keep any backlog. It is very important to solve
                                        as many previous question papers as possible. I would rest my case on a final
                                        note that, if Paathshala is given the opportunity to compete at the higher
                                        level, it would gain all the honours and respect it truly deserves!! &nbsp; <i

                                        should be solved and Devansh's success is to be attributed to the fact that he
                                        scored minimum negative marks in both JEE Main and JEE Advanced. To the entrance
                                        exam aspirants, we would say, there has to be regular study by the student for 2
                                        years. The student should be thorough with the concepts, formulas, theory,

                                        joined a different institute but over there, my concepts were not being
                                        clarified] Hence, I have joined Paathshala later. My concept clarity
                                        strengthened with time. My frequency of solving problems without making silly
                                        mistakes has increased. Also, the time taken by me for solving each sum has
                                        reduced. This capability has become an integral part of me. I have also learnt a
                                        lot about life at Paathshala. I can feel the connection between Maths and Life.
                                        'Integration' taught me that if you keep adding up small efforts, you WILL make
                                        it large despite any obstacles of 'what to substitute'. Plus, you will get the
