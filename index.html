                                            To merely explain my experience and emotions with Paathshala with a few
                                            words ? Oh Boy! It's
                                            going to be a task between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea. My 2 year
                                            experience here was an
                                            adventure. Professors here helped me a lot in teaching, doubts, concepts
                                            clarification. I
                                            would say they are true experts of their subjects. The professors here are
                                            the best! The
                                            environment and ambience of the classrooms was far beyond my expectation.
                                            Good
                                            infrastructure, comfortable benches, quality teaching facilities, you name
                                            it! Learning here
                                            was fun and the environment maintained by the teachers was cherry on the
                                            cake. Our senior
                                            students also gave us the information about the mighty class in our 11 Std.
                                            I was also given
                                            the right guidance about the books to be referred to in addition to the
                                            study materials
                                            provided. I would rest my case on a final note that, if Paathshala is given
                                            the opportunity
                                            to compete at the higher level, it would gain all the honours and respect it
                                            truly
                                            deserves!!

                                            My experience with Paathshala is absolutely fantastic. In the beginning
                                            itself, Professor
                                            Sagar Sir had given Nihar a view of the goal and how to reach that goal and
                                            how to start.
                                            Taking admission here did wonders for Nihar. The way of teaching by the
                                            faculties was very
                                            good as Nihar was very enthusiastic and loved going to Paathshala classes
                                            without missing
                                            even a single class. All the credit for Nihar’s success in the exams goes to
                                            the staff and
                                            faculty of Paathshala.

                                            personalized attention to the student. I studied for about 5-6 hours daily. I gave more time
                                            to the subject I was weak at. I revised the topics done in the class daily. And this helped
                                            me a lot in improving my scores in the exams. I also learnt how to manage my time and how
                                            not to make silly mistakes. The professors are knowledgeable and I give them a rating of
                                            10/10. I was also counseled about the opportunities available to me after successful
                                            completion of JEE. I am planning to do Mechanical Engineering at IIT.

                                            helps students to ask their doubts and also the professor to gauge the understanding of the
                                            student. It helps them to gain confidence when the concepts are cleared and the results will
                                            be definitely good. I will give 100% credit of Saurabh's success to Paathshala as they are
                                            service oriented.

                                            My experience at Paatshala was very good. The one thing I liked here is that they provide
                                            great academic support which helped me excel in all the subjects. The professors are
                                            experienced and provide us in depth knowledge of the subject. My scores improved a lot in
                                            all the subjects. For the future batches of Paathshala, I will say that you should stick to
                                            the portion and the study material that is provided. Whenever you have doubts, get it
                                            cleared with the professors. The study materials, the class notes and the assignments given
                                            at the class are enough for getting good marks in JEE. I also got to know tips and
                                            techniques and time management strategies from the counselor which were very helpful. My
                                            rating of Paathshala is 10/10 as the staff and faculty are very supportive.

                                            Irrespective of the exams I was to appear I was counseled by the professors who taught me

                                            a way that I could put them into application and use them to solve the problems correctly.
                                            For the JEE aspirants, I would like to say that study all the concepts but do a smart study.
                                            Revise whatever you have learnt thoroughly and solve maximum practice questions.

                                            We had a wonderful and happy experience at Paathshala. All the faculties gave Devansh
                                            personalized attention and solved all his doubts. We used to get the guidance from
                                            professors from time to time. All these have contributed towards Devansh succeeding in JEE
                                            Advanced. Before the exams, the professors explained to us which topic is to be covered,
                                            which topic should be solved and Devansh's success is to be attributed to the fact that he
                                            scored minimum negative marks in both JEE Main and JEE Advanced. To the entrance exam
                                            aspirants, we would say, there has to be regular study by the student for 2 years. The
                                            student should be thorough with the concepts, formulas, theory, definition and clear the
                                            doubts immediately with the professors.

                                            It is a great feeling to have been a student of Paathshala, have gotten to learn from all
                                            the professors here. Every professor has taught me valuable life lessons too. [After my 10th
                                            Std, I have joined a different institute but over there, my concepts were not being
                                            clarified] Hence, I have joined Paathshala later. My concept clarity strengthened with time.
                                            My frequency of solving problems without making silly mistakes has increased. Also, the time
                                            taken by me for solving each sum has reduced. This capability has become an integral part of
                                            me. I have also learnt a lot about life at Paathshala. I can feel the connection between
                                            Maths and Life. 'Integration' taught me that if you keep adding up small efforts, you WILL
                                            make it large despite any obstacles of 'what to substitute'. Plus, you will get the added
                                            bonus of '+C' in the end. It's your life, make it large!

                                            from the class as she learnt the subjects in depth. She was given daily assignments to
                                            complete. It really improved her test scores including MCQs. For the NEET aspirants, I will
                                            say one has to be very focused and planned with studies. Also, indulge in extra curricular
                                            activities like sports or music to relax.

                                            I have good experience studying at Paathshala. Here the student gets all the required
                                            facilities and study material required for perfect preparation. The classification of the
                                            topics into subtopics has helped in better understanding of the concepts in that topic.
                                            Also, the classes are conducted in small batches which enables the professor to give
                                            personalized attention to the student. The student is encouraged to ask questions and clear
                                            all his doubts. I was initially in a different institute before joining Paathshala. I would
                                            have to work much much harder if I were at some other institute, where they start the
                                            portion slowly but in the end moments they finish the portion. That too they don’t teach
                                            properly. They give you a mix bag of theories; you need to go into it and search out the
                                            important points. Here at Paathshala Education, the professors are knowledgeable and
                                            provided personalized attention to each student and clear all their doubts on the subject.
                                            They guide you properly and give what is actually required. For entrance exam aspirants, I
                                            would say do not count the number of hours you study instead solve more conceptual questions
                                            because this is what that develops our concepts. As soon as you finish theory, start off
                                            with practice papers of previous years and solve them as much as possible.

                                            Before joining Paathshala, my experience with another institute was not good. At Paathshala,
                                            I was able to understand the concepts of the subject clearly and became confident and
                                            interested in the subjects. The professors taught me from the basics of 11th standard and
                                            made me capable of solving MCQs of JEE Main level quickly. Also, I was made to solve lots of
                                            questions from previous years' tests. I could understand the questions and what I am
                                            supposed to answer. I would advise the future batches of Paathshala to stay focused on
                                            studies, clear your concepts of each topic and solve as many questions as possible. And
                                            beware of the marketing strategies used by the coaching classes and don't fall prey to them.
                                            I did initially fall prey to such tactics and joined a different class before joining
                                            Paathshlala and had to leave it eventually.
