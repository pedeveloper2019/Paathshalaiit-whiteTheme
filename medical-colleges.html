                                The academic policies of each IIT are decided by its Senate. This comprises all
                                professors of the IIT and student representatives. Unlike many western universities that
                                have an elected senate, the IITs have an academic senate. It controls and approves the
                                curriculum, courses, examinations and results, and appoints committees to look into
                                specific academic matters. The teaching, training and research activities of the
                                institute are periodically reviewed by the senate to maintain educational standards. The
                                Director of an IIT is the ex-officio Chairman of the Senate.

                                Central Library, IIT Roorkee All the IITs follow the credits system of performance
                                evaluation, with proportional weighting of courses based on their importance. The total
                                marks (usually out of 100) form the basis of grades, with a grade value (out of 10)
                                assigned to a range of marks. Sometimes, relative grading is done considering the
                                overall performance of the whole class. For each semester, the students are graded on a
                                scale of 0 to 10 based on their performance, by taking a weighted average of the grade
                                points from all the courses, with their respective credit points. Each semester
                                evaluation is done independently and then the weighted average over all semesters is
                                used to calculate the cumulative grade point average (known as CGPA or CPI—Cumulative
                                Performance Index).
